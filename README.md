# HTML Crash Course

Use this as a quick introduction into HTML that will teach you the basics needed to follow along in my other web development courses.

## Branches

I'll create branches that represent the code used in my YouTube tutorials at certain points in the tutorials. When I give challenges in the tutorials, you can check out the appropriate "challenge" branch to do the challenge yourself. Then you can check the "solution" branch to compare your solution to my example solution. I highly recommend you do the challenges because writing code yourself will help you learn much faster than just watching me write it.
